  <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
  <p>
    Dog waste left on sidewalks, in parks, and public spaces is more than just an annoyanceâ€”it's a public health concern.
    Unattended dog waste can:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Transmit diseases and parasites</li>
    <li>Pollute our waterways when washed into storm drains</li>
    <li>Create slip hazards for pedestrians</li>
    <li>Make our beautiful Brooklyn neighborhoods less pleasant to walk through</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  <p>
    Our community-driven map allows residents to:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Report poop sightings with location and description</li>
    <li>View areas with high concentrations of reported waste</li>
    <li>Raise awareness about neighborhood cleanliness</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h2>Join the Movement</h2>
  <p>
