          Some cities have neighborhood watch groups. <strong>Brooklyn has us.</strong><br><br>
          Have you ever stepped in something and thought, "I wish someone had warned me"?<br>
          Ever wanted to make an impact on your neighborhood but also not really?<br>
          Do you believe in radical pedestrian safety?<br>
          <strong>Then you're one of us.</strong><br><br>
          Brooklyn Poop Map is the only (up to 3/9/2025) hyper-local, community-driven, and 100% unnecessary solution to this urban dilemma. Our team of unpaid, unqualified experts (read: random internet users) are mapping the menace one turd at a time.
